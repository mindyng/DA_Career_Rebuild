* find the intersection between strengths, passion and demand

# Competitive Edge
* with market-industry around me, what I am best at, better at than others, what is my edge
* assets (how you get there), market realities, asipirations (goals, where you want to go)
* assets - $$, soft -who I know, my skillset (amplify, develop them), what was going on in the industry, know who to call to solve questions, and how to evolve these
* people and skills - key problem to solve (in start-up like falling off a cliff and need to build a plane, fires everywhere, need to determine what to focus on with advisors)
* edge: play your strengths, passions/aspirations, tiger-mom approach- figure out market needs and go do that
* what should I invest in: assets, aspirations, market realities
* do intense plan for couple of years only, excecute it and pay attn (passions can change, assets are increasing, market is changing)
* real relationships with allies are essential (as well as acquaintances who have different interests than you)
* flexible persistence (vision, mission, conviction, flexible-really customer demand, product-market fit)
* domain experts (get options, day-to-day), personally know you well (mom- know who I am), smart people but have perspective to add (cross-check)

# Networks
### how will people find me, people are looking for people to solve problems
* can change the curve of business/how I operate
* ~allies (time, emotional investment), colleagues, tackling world together~
* identify people you're going through life with; explicit conversations are needed (specific, not trade-in alliance), working on together and help each other 
* pick investments together, key trends; learn faster and direct companies better
* 1 + 1 > 2
* acquaintances - friendly but not full-on friends, large swath that spans industries, diversity of ideas, fresh blood
* need both alliances and acquintances- blend of close and weak ties valuable with coherent trust dymanic and plent of informational diversity
* this works for start-up's
* online networking just amplifies connections
* be thoughtful and systemic how I am building alliances and acquaintances - how I help others
* ~theory of small gifts - give people something valuable to them~
* interesting people find/free commitment strategy- pre-allocating time, energy, money to this
* meeting new person even someone famous - referral from someone you know and trust, but can always help them (information they have not heard before)
* connect based on another person
* be attentive to how you can help
* really careful about what you are doing is not an ask
* double intro- are you intested in meeting from both parties
* common humor

# Risks
* attack risks, take intelligent risks - driving initiatives with intelligent risks
* mortal (consequences are really bad)/immortal risk- huge amount of energy that it goes well bc highly adverse
* intelligent risk - immortal risk can question your loyalty to current responsibilities, not being a great idea, but put extra work, approaching mgr, aggreeing, having others work with him- easiest way, help out in some way other team for free
* competitive edge- take intelligent risk and knowing how to manage it
* start-up - moving so quickly, can't fill in every variable in risk model, limited info, so much uncertainty
* ~if worst case scenario survivable then will take on risk
* if not much competition then have time to build business leadership skills
* what if you don't know market realities/totally new domain, not a substitution -  use network, and if hypothesis is true, what other things can I observe - proxy to psychological mindset, test it with cheap shots, do something small and get some data on it

# Entrepreneural Mindset
* ovreall arching mindset, approach to life - permanent beta
* always growing, iterating, improving, always Day 1 to not rest on laurels, not dwelling on past successes
* not finished; otherwise, that's when competitor will overtake them, work in progress
* always invest in self, continue to adapt and evolve (competitive edge, network, intelligent risks)
* Benjamin Franklin - will I go to bed tonight smarter than I am right now?
* keep reinventing self

* to bootstrap
* financing- think of next round- higher valuation (progress), island-hopping, prove to have broader range of investors to invest in
* where to get best possible data to accelerate users; customer flow; figuring out how to acquire, better quality, efficient, consistent way
* opportunities- careers don't work with series of jobs, but puncutated with breakout opportunities to accelerate co, best way to hustle is to interact with hustlers who have been able to survive
* sage advice- investment is like marriage, how to build really good relationship fast, risk: what are the risks and how you are trying to manage it (if don't mention risk- blind or lying) to build trust and confidence
