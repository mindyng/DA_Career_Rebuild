## A good metric is comparative. 
Being able to compare a metric to other time
periods, groups of users, or competitors helps you understand which way things
are moving. “Increased conversion from last week” is more meaningful than
“2% conversion.”

## A good metric is understandable. 
If people can’t remember it and discuss it,
it’s much harder to turn a change in the data into a change in the culture.

## A good metric is a ratio or a rate. 
Accountants and financial analysts have
several ratios they look at to understand, at a glance, the fundamental health of a
company.
You need some, too.
There are several reasons ratios tend to be the best metrics:

## Ratios are easier to act on. 
Think about driving a car. Distance travelled is
informational. But speed—distance per hour—is something you can act on,
because it tells you about your current state, and whether you need to go
faster or slower to get to your destination on time.

## Ratios are inherently comparative. 
If you compare a daily metric to the
same metric over a month, you’ll see whether you’re looking at a sudden
spike or a long-term trend. In a car, speed is one metric, but speed right now
over average speed this hour shows you a lot about whether you’re
accelerating or slowing down.

## Ratios are also good for comparing factors that are somehow opposed, or for which there’s an inherent tension. 
In a car, this might be distance covered divided by traffic tickets. The faster you drive, the more distance you
cover—but the more tickets you get. This ratio might suggest whether or not
you should be breaking the speed limit.
