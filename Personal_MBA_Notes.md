# Marketing
- Without prospects, you won’t sell anything, and without completing profitable transactions, your business will fail.
- To get someone’s attention, you have to find a way around their filters.
- You want the attention of prospects who will ultimately purchase from you— otherwise, you’re wasting your time
- Receptivity: they’re interested in almost anything they can find about their obsession as soon as it’s available. From a business perspective, that’s ideal —it’s difficult to offer something that this audience won’t want immediately
- Receptivity has two primary components: what and when
- Advertising is the tax you pay for being unremarkable. —ROBERT STEPHENS, FOUNDER OF GEEK SQUAD
- From a business perspective, the Attention-grabbing design of FiveFingers is working beautifully
- Being Remarkable is the best way to attract Attention
- Attention to close enough sales to produce enough profit to keep going. To do that, it’s best to focus on attracting the attention of the people who will actually care about what you’re doing
- Your Probable Purchaser is the type of person who is perfectly suited to what you’re offering
- Marketing is most effective when it focuses on the desired End Result, which is usually a distinctive experience or emotion related to a Core Human Drive. The actual function of the purchase is important, but the End Result is what the prospect is most interested in hearing about. It’s often far more comfortable to focus on the features: you know what your offer does. Even so, it’s far more effective to focus on the benefits: what your offer will provide to customers. The End Result is what matters most. By focusing on the End Result, you’re homing in on what will cause your prospect to conclude, “This is for me.”

number of highly profitable customers it insures while funneling the “bad
risks” directly to their competitors.
