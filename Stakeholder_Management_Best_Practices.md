	• Slow down
	• Context, relationships (the stakes, how people are processing things)
	• Impact Analysis - pro's and con's, mitigate (make less severe) changes
	• How to communicate to Executive team members
	• Stakeholders' needs, build trust, shared approach, execution plan how they wanted things to roll out
	
	Aligning Data Priorities to Business Priorities
	
	• Active Listening (helping to define ask)
	• Ground the project for available resources and capacities (limit on compute/bits/electricity
	• Translate effectively technical context to non-technical people
		○ Some requests are low lift
		○ Sometimes lot of effort
			§ Ad-hoc- context switch from prioritizing from current task from queue
		○ People really need to know what it takes to get to the answer 
			§ break it down, lay it all out 
				□ consistently until built processes are not last-minute
				□ Even for executive team 
			§ Lift the curtain, let them take a peek the effort it will take
		○ Self-serve-how to get to the answer themselves with what already lives, these are the options
			§ Takes work to show people data resources and how to ask data q's
		○ What does their ask mean?
			§ New table
				□ For non-repeatable ask?
			§ Ingest data that did not exist
		○ One click, overnight solution not realistic all the time
	• Know the decision-makers
		○ Stakeholder maps
			§ Who has power to make decision and why
			§ Can influence project but not decision-making
			§ Allies/enemies
		○ What will you need it for? Driving a particular action?
	• Managing Competing Priorities
		○ Understanding business context and personal agendas
			§ Asking the right questions, specific need- ask, why, what, when, where
			§ Understand stakeholders, understand business
			§ Keep probing 
		○ Aim to Over Communicate
			§ What are some phrases you can say, "No" but still keep stakeholder trust high
				□ Understanding biz context and personal agendas
				□ For me to be comfortable to say no, need to know where they are coming from and what the friction is between each other's POV
				□ Trust and friction, to work through it to get to the right resolution
				□ What you are trying to solve for, why approach is the way it is, and an opinion; HW to get comfortable, confidence
				□ No is not one phrase but answering Who, What, When, Where, Why, How, am I missing a viewpoint
				□ Stakeholder is my customer
				□ Tight deadline then need to have a quick response, address quickly
				□ Queue is too long, low value ask, my approach is very different than their approach, so I need to explain my approach; why
				□ One pager, bullet points, core questions
			§ Be proactive in communication (when doing so much) - not wait until they ask me for update. 
				□ Need to give details on my steps and where I am at; blockers
		○ At the end, stakeholder and analyst need to go to the same place
			§ Sometimes expectation and results are different
		○ Start small with saying "no"
			§ Is more work
			§ Then when you say it comes from place very well thought out
		○ Personal Agendas
			§ Sometimes need to explain decision-making will cause technical debt
			§ Documentation is your BFF to explain decision consequences

	• What you want to do, why, how
		○ Lean Start-up 3 Why's
	• Building on process- Stakeholders who keep on asking low-value requests
		○ Investigate, how do these requests come in and how often, is there a pattern to it
		○ Are there processes to manage this
		○ So simple, but what is it being used for?
			§ Need process, need to formalize requests
			§ Tickets need to be submitted certain way
			§ Triage-what is it aligning to
			§ Outlined KPI's, goals for quarter/6 months, how are my tasks aligned at this moment
		○ Low-value, able to coach-up; knowledge share, coaching; know how to ask right questions and get answers on their own
		○ Are there things more important for data team and stakeholders know it?
		○ This is how we intake, and how we can support them
	• Not everything is life and death
		○ Want to immediately solve
		○ Really prioritize trust
		○ Shared decision, what will it take to get everyone on same pg
		○ Sometimes work with them offline to make sure they are my ally
		○ Timeline is sometimes arbitrary- unless something is tomorrow 
		○ Documentation- people will understand money, they will reconsider their task- dependencies; short- (technical debt?) and long-terms answers; options
		○ People management, relationship building
			§ Resonate, get buy-in to have impact
	• Need to get really good at what people need
	• What are their assumptions that data could do for them and where am I right now? (infra, stack, tools)
	• At the end of the day, data is people
	• Impact Analysis- understand questions that have not been answered and generate scenarios to answer questions
